Hello, how run the example ? ? ?

1. Download the "ExtDirect.php.zip" file from post #1 of this thread.

2. Unzip the file

3. Copy the extracted files (ExtDirect.php, example.php, and example.html) to your web site folder (requires PHP and and HTTP, like Apache or NginX)

4. Using your browser, go to the URL where you can access "example.html"... it can be "http://localhost/example.com" or something else, according to your settings.
